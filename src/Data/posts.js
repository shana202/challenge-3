        <p>Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are modern layout systems. Choosing the right one depends on your layout needs.</p>
        <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
        <p>Best for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns).</p>
        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p>Best for one-dimensional layouts (rows <strong>or</strong> columns).</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Use Grid when you need a full page layout.</li>
          <li>Use Flexbox when you're aligning items in a single row or column.</li>
